# BiskitBunch NFT

Welcome to the BiskitBunch NFT project! This NFT grants access to various projects that the BiskitBunch team is building in the web3 space. The BiskitBunch is a community for creators who are learning and innovating in the world of decentralized technology.

To manage access to our projects, I have implemented an on-chain allowlist using the Alchemy documentation as a guide. This allowlist is stored on the blockchain and allows me to easily manage who has access to our projects.

In order to store the metadata for our NFTs, I have chosen to use nft_storage. This service stores the metadata in two ways: on dedicated IPFS servers managed by them and decentralised on Filecoin. I believe that this combination of centralized and decentralized storage provides the best balance of reliability and security for our NFTs.

Thank you for your interest in the BiskitBunch NFT. I hope that you will join us in our journey to learn and innovate in the world of decentralized technology.
